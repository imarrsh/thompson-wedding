# Wedding Website Project
Hey! Nice to see you here.

## Why this project exists
This repo is a personal experiment in building a website with Gatsby.js. My fianc√© and I are getting married on October 9, 2021, and I thought it would be a fun side project to stand up a website for our wedding. This project is inspired by concepts from Wes Bos' [Master Gatsby](https://mastergatsby.com) course.

Of course, there are myriad services out there that offer templates on the cheap, but whats the fun in that?

## More to come
If this project interests you, feel free to check back periodically - less than a year til the wedding!
